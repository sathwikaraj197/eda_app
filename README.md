# Python Web App to Automate EDA

This repo contains code for a Python web app to Automate the EDA process to some extent. I created a simple app where you can upload the CSV dataset you want to analyze. Once you upload a dataset, various charts with default values get created. You can change various widget values to modify charts. The app also displays various basic statistics about the dataset. It took me less than 120 lines of code to create this mind-blowing web app. You can go ahead and extend this app further by adding much more functionalities.

Please feel free to check the video below to understand the codebase in detail.
